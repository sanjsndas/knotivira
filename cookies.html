                <h1>Knotivira Cookie Policy</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated: July 5, 2025</strong></p>
                <p>Welcome to Knotivira.com ("Site"). This Cookie Policy explains how Knotivira ("we," "our," or "us") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website. This policy provides comprehensive details about what cookies are, the types of cookies we use, the purposes for which we use them, and how you can manage your cookie preferences. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our data collection practices. By continuing to browse and use our Site, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with this Cookie Policy. If you do not agree to the use of cookies, please adjust your browser settings or refrain from using our Site as described herein.</p>
                <p>This Cookie Policy should be read in conjunction with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which provides more extensive information about how we collect, use, and protect your personal data. We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our use of cookies.</p>

                <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser. The primary function of cookies is to enable a website to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>
                <p>Beyond simple memory functions, cookies serve a multitude of purposes. They can be used to track your browsing behavior, remember your login details, store items in your shopping cart, personalize content, and deliver targeted advertisements. They play a crucial role in enhancing user experience by making interactions with websites faster and more convenient. Without cookies, websites would treat you as a completely new visitor every time you navigate to a new page, making tasks like online shopping or logging into an account cumbersome and inefficient. The data stored within cookies is typically anonymous or pseudonymized, meaning it doesn't directly identify you unless combined with other information you've provided.</p>
                <p>The information stored in cookies can include the date and time of your visit, the pages viewed, the time spent on the site, and the websites visited just before and just after our Site. This data helps us understand user behavior patterns, identify popular content, and diagnose technical issues, all contributing to the continuous improvement of our services. It's important to understand that cookies themselves do not contain personal information like your name or email address directly, unless you have explicitly provided that information to the website. Instead, they often contain a unique identifier that allows the website to recognize your browser on subsequent visits.</p>
                <p>Cookies are a fundamental technology in modern web browsing. They enable a personalized and efficient online experience by allowing websites to "remember" information about you. This can range from simple preferences, like your language choice, to more complex data, such as the contents of your shopping cart across multiple browsing sessions. The data stored in cookies is typically small in size and does not directly execute code or carry viruses. They are simply data files that facilitate communication between your browser and the website's server. Understanding how cookies function is key to managing your online privacy effectively.</p>
                <p>The lifespan of a cookie varies. Session cookies are temporary and are erased when you close your browser. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, remain on your device for a set period, which can range from a few minutes to several years, or until you manually delete them. These longer-lasting cookies are often used for remembering login details, tracking preferences across visits, or for advertising purposes. The ability of websites to set and read cookies is governed by your browser settings and, increasingly, by privacy regulations that require explicit user consent for certain types of cookies.</p>

                <h2>2. Types of Cookies We Use and Their Purposes</h2>
                <p>Knotivira uses various types of cookies for different purposes to ensure the optimal functioning of our Site and to enhance your overall experience. Understanding these categories will help you make informed decisions about your cookie preferences.</p>

                <h3>2.1. Strictly Necessary Cookies (Essential Cookies)</h3>
                <p>These cookies are absolutely essential for the Site to function properly and securely. Without these cookies, certain services you have asked for cannot be provided, and the Site may not operate as intended. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. Because they are fundamental to the operation of the Site, they cannot be switched off in our systems. If you block these cookies through your browser settings, some parts of the Site will not work or will not work correctly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable core website functionality, security, and accessibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remembering items placed in your shopping cart across different pages or visits.</li>
                            <li>Allowing you to log into secure areas of the Site and maintaining your session.</li>
                            <li>Remembering your cookie consent preferences.</li>
                            <li>Ensuring the security of your transactions and protecting against fraudulent activities.</li>
                            <li>Load balancing to distribute website traffic efficiently.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Impact of Disabling:</strong> The Site will likely not function correctly, and you may be unable to complete purchases or access your account.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These cookies are fundamental to providing a seamless and secure browsing experience. They are the backbone of any interactive website, ensuring that basic functionalities like user authentication and shopping cart management work without interruption. Their necessity means they are typically exempt from explicit consent requirements in many privacy regulations, as they are considered part of the "service requested by the user." However, we still inform you of their presence and purpose.</p>

                <h3>2.2. Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use our Site, for instance, which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies do not collect information that directly identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. They are used only to improve how a website works. By understanding how users interact with our Site, we can identify areas for improvement, optimize content, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To measure and improve the performance of our Site, understand user behavior, and gather statistical data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Google Analytics cookies: Collect data on website traffic, page views, time spent on pages, and user demographics (anonymized).</li>
                            <li>Identifying popular products, patterns, or content sections.</li>
                            <li>Monitoring website loading speeds and identifying technical issues.</li>
                            <li>Tracking the effectiveness of different design layouts or features.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Impact of Disabling:</strong> While the Site will remain functional, our ability to understand and improve its performance will be limited, potentially leading to a less optimized experience over time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These cookies are invaluable for data-driven decision-making. They help us continuously refine our Site to better serve your needs. For example, if analytics show that a particular page has a high bounce rate, we can investigate why and make improvements. This continuous feedback loop is vital for maintaining a high-quality online platform. We typically use third-party services for these analytics, and the data is processed in an aggregated and anonymized manner to protect your privacy.</p>

                <h3>2.3. Functionality Cookies</h3>
                <p>Functionality cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, they can remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To enhance personalization and remember your preferences for a more convenient browsing experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remembering your login details for future visits (if you choose "remember me").</li>
                            <li>Storing your preferred language or currency settings.</li>
                            <li>Remembering items you've viewed recently.</li>
                            <li>Enabling video playback or interactive features on the Site.</li>
                            <li>Pre-filling forms with previously entered information.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Impact of Disabling:</strong> Your experience may be less personalized, and you may need to re-enter preferences or login details more frequently.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These cookies aim to make your interaction with Knotivira more seamless and tailored to your individual preferences. By remembering your choices, they save you time and effort, contributing to a more enjoyable and efficient browsing session. For example, if you set a specific filter preference in our yarn atelier, a functionality cookie can remember that preference for your next visit, saving you the trouble of re-applying it.</p>

                <h3>2.4. Targeting and Advertising Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers. This means that after you have visited our Site, you may see advertisements about Knotivira on other websites, or advertisements about other products or services that may be of interest to you.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To deliver personalized advertisements and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Retargeting: Showing you ads for products you viewed on Knotivira after you leave our Site.</li>
                            <li>Audience segmentation: Grouping users with similar interests to deliver relevant ads.</li>
                            <li>Tracking ad impressions and clicks to measure campaign performance.</li>
                            <li>Preventing you from seeing the same advertisement too many times.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Impact of Disabling:</strong> You will still see advertisements, but they may be less relevant to your interests.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These cookies are crucial for our marketing efforts, allowing us to reach potential customers who are genuinely interested in fiber arts and our products. They help us make our advertising more efficient and less intrusive by showing you ads that are more likely to be relevant. We work with reputable advertising partners who adhere to industry standards for data privacy and security. Disabling these cookies does not mean you will no longer see ads; it simply means the ads you see will be less tailored to your browsing habits.</p>

                <h3>2.5. Social Media Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the Site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies, you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable social media sharing features and track interactions for social media marketing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Like" or "Share" buttons from Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest.</li>
                            <li>Embedding social media feeds on our Site.</li>
                            <li>Tracking user engagement with our content on social media platforms.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Impact of Disabling:</strong> You may not be able to share content directly from our Site to social media, and your social media experience may be less integrated.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Social media cookies facilitate your connection with Knotivira on your preferred platforms. They allow for seamless sharing of our beautiful patterns and yarns, helping our community grow. While they do track your activity across sites, this is typically done by the social media platform itself, in accordance with their own privacy policies. We merely integrate their tools to enhance your sharing capabilities on our Site.</p>

                <h3>2.6. First-Party vs. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First-Party Cookies:</strong> These are cookies set by the website you are visiting (Knotivira.com). They are generally used to store your preferences, remember your login details, or manage your shopping cart. They are typically essential or functionality cookies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> These are cookies set by a domain other than the one you are visiting. This typically happens when the website incorporates elements from other sites, such as images, social media plugins, or advertising. Third-party cookies are often used for cross-site tracking, analytics, and advertising purposes. For example, Google Analytics cookies are third-party cookies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding the distinction between first-party and third-party cookies is crucial for managing your privacy. First-party cookies are directly controlled by Knotivira and are primarily used to enhance your experience on our Site. Third-party cookies, while often beneficial for analytics and personalized advertising, are controlled by external entities, and their data usage is governed by those entities' privacy policies. We carefully select our third-party partners to ensure they adhere to high standards of data protection.</p>

                <h3>2.7. Session vs. Persistent Cookies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These are temporary cookies that remain on your device only for the duration of your browsing session. They are deleted automatically once you close your web browser. They are often used for essential functionalities like remembering items in your shopping cart during a single visit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> These cookies remain on your device for a longer period, even after you close your browser. They have an expiration date set by the website (which can be minutes, days, or even years) or remain until you manually delete them. They are used to remember your preferences, login details, or for tracking purposes across multiple visits.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The duration of a cookie impacts its purpose. Session cookies are ideal for short-term interactions, ensuring continuity within a single visit. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, are designed for long-term memory, enabling a more personalized and convenient experience over time, such as remembering your preferences or login status for future visits. Both types play a role in optimizing your interaction with Knotivira.</p>

                <h3>2.8. Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
                <p>In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web Beacons (Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs):</strong> These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. They help us to understand if emails have been opened or if specific pages have been viewed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Storage (HTML5 Local Storage):</strong> This technology allows websites to store larger amounts of data directly in the browser, similar to cookies but with greater capacity. It can be used to remember user preferences, offline data, or even user-generated content for a longer period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flash Cookies (Local Shared Objects):</strong> These are data files that can be created by sites that use Adobe Flash. They are similar to cookies in that they store information on your device to remember settings, preferences, or usage. However, they are managed through the Flash Player settings rather than directly through your browser.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Fingerprinting:</strong> This involves collecting information about your device's configuration (e.g., browser type, operating system, installed fonts, screen resolution) to create a unique "fingerprint" that can identify your device across different websites and sessions. This is a more advanced tracking method.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These technologies serve similar purposes to cookies, primarily for analytics, personalization, and advertising. While they may not be managed through standard browser cookie settings, many browsers and privacy tools offer options to control or block these as well. We use these technologies to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how our Site is used and to deliver a consistent and relevant experience.</p>

                <h2>3. How to Manage Your Cookie Preferences</h2>
                <p>Knotivira respects your right to control your cookie preferences. You have several options to manage, accept, or decline cookies. Please note that disabling certain cookies may impact the functionality and your experience on our Site.</p>

                <h3>3.1. Using Our Cookie Consent Tool</h3>

                        <li><strong>Manage Preferences:</strong> Access a detailed preference center where you can individually select which categories of non-essential cookies you wish to allow or block.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>You can revisit your cookie preferences at any time by clicking on the "Cookie Settings" link, typically found in the footer of our Site, or by clearing your browser's cookies and revisiting the Site.</p>
                <p>Our cookie consent tool is designed to provide you with granular control over your data. We aim to make the process of managing your preferences as straightforward and transparent as possible. By using this tool, you can tailor your experience to your comfort level regarding data collection and personalization. We log your consent choices to ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations and to respect your preferences on subsequent visits.</p>

                <h3>3.2. Browser Settings</h3>
                <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can usually find these settings in the "Options" or "Preferences" menu of your browser. Here's a general guide for popular browsers:</p>

                <h3>3.3. Opt-Out Links for Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>Many third-party advertising networks and analytics providers offer their own opt-out mechanisms. You can visit the following links to opt-out of their tracking cookies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on:</strong> <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Tool (for US):</strong> <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></li>
                    <li><strong>European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Opt-Out Tool (for EU):</strong> <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page:</strong> <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Facebook Ad Preferences:</strong> You can manage your Facebook ad preferences directly within your Facebook account settings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Opting out of specific advertising networks does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It means that the companies from which you have opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns. You may still receive generic or contextual ads.</p>

                <h3>3.4. Mobile Device Settings</h3>
                <p>If you access our Site from a mobile device, your device may also allow you to control cookies and advertising identifiers. For example, on iOS devices, you can enable "Limit Ad Tracking" in your privacy settings. On Android devices, you can enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization." Consult your device's documentation for specific instructions.</p>
                <p>These settings provide an additional layer of control over how your mobile device shares data for advertising purposes. It's important to review both your browser settings and your mobile device settings to ensure your preferences are consistently applied across all your online activities.</p>

                <h2>4. Your Rights Regarding Cookies and Data</h2>
                <p>As part of our commitment to data privacy, we recognize and support your rights concerning the data collected through cookies and other tracking technologies. These rights are particularly relevant for users in regions governed by comprehensive data protection laws like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK, and the CCPA/CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act/California Privacy Rights Act) in California.</p>

                <h3>4.1. Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
                <p>Where our use of cookies is based on your consent, you have the absolute right to withdraw that consent at any time. This can typically be done through our cookie consent tool (accessible via a link in the footer) or by adjusting your browser settings as described in Section 3. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before your withdrawal. Once we receive your withdrawal of consent, we will cease using the relevant cookies and processing data collected through them, unless there is another legal basis for such processing (e.g., for strictly necessary cookies).</p>
                <p>It is important to understand that withdrawing consent for certain cookie categories (e.g., performance or advertising) will only prevent future data collection via those cookies. It will not delete data already collected, though you may have a separate right to erasure for that data, as discussed below. We strive to make the consent withdrawal process as straightforward as the consent granting process, ensuring you retain full control over your data preferences.</p>

                <h3>4.2. Right to Access Your Cookie-Related Data</h3>
                <p>You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you that may have been collected through cookies or other tracking technologies. This includes information about the types of data collected, the purposes of processing, and any third parties with whom this data has been shared. To exercise this right, please contact us using the details provided in Section 6. We will provide you with a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, subject to verification of your identity and any legal limitations.</p>
                <p>This right allows you to understand what specific information about your browsing habits or preferences has been associated with your unique cookie identifiers. While cookie data is often pseudonymized, when it can be linked to an identifiable individual (e.g., through an account login), it falls under personal data and is subject to your access rights. We are committed to providing transparent access to this information to empower your data privacy choices.</p>

                <h3>4.3. Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)</h3>
                <p>In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion or removal of your personal data, including data collected via cookies, where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. This right applies if, for example, the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, or you withdraw your consent and there is no other legal basis for processing. Please note that this right is not absolute and may be subject to legal exceptions, such as retaining data for legal compliance, fraud prevention, or the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
                <p>If you wish to exercise your right to erasure concerning cookie-related data, please contact us. We will assess your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws and take appropriate steps to delete or anonymize your data where feasible and legally required. Deleting cookies from your browser directly is often the quickest way to remove locally stored cookie data, but exercising the right to erasure with us ensures that any server-side data linked to those cookies is also addressed.</p>

                <h3>4.4. Other Data Protection Rights</h3>
                <p>Beyond the rights specifically related to cookies, your broader data protection rights (as detailed in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>) also apply to any personal data collected through cookies. These may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> The right to have inaccurate personal data corrected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Restriction of Processing:</strong> The right to request that we limit the way we use your data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> The right to receive your personal data in a portable format.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> The right to object to processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For detailed information on how to exercise these broader rights, please refer to Section 6 of our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. We are dedicated to upholding all your data protection rights and providing the necessary mechanisms for you to exercise control over your personal information.</p>
