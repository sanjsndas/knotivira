                <p>We attempt to be as accurate as possible in the descriptions of our Products and Digital Products. However, Knotivira does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of this Site is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products, and prices of products and services described or depicted on the Site are subject to change at any time without notice.</p>
                <p>Colors may vary slightly from what appears online due to differences in monitor calibration, lighting conditions, and the inherent nature of natural fibers and hand-dyed yarns. We recommend referring to physical samples or contacting customer service if precise color matching is critical for your project.</p>

                <h3>3.2. Pricing and Availability</h3>
                <p>All prices for Products and Digital Products are listed in the currency specified on the Site and are subject to change without notice. Prices do not include applicable taxes, duties, shipping, or handling charges, which will be added to your total at checkout. We reserve the right to correct any errors in pricing or product descriptions and to cancel or refuse any order placed based on incorrect information.</p>
                <p>Product availability is subject to change. While we endeavor to keep our inventory updated, there may be instances where an item you ordered is out of stock.

                <p>We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household, or per order.

                <p>Most orders for physical products are processed and shipped within [X] business days (e.g., 1-3 business days) of order placement, excluding weekends and public holidays. You will receive a shipping confirmation email with tracking information once your order has been dispatched.</p>

                <h3>5.5. Customs, Duties, and Taxes (International Orders)</h3>
                <p>For international orders, you are responsible for any customs duties, taxes, tariffs, or other fees imposed by the destination country. These charges are not included in the product price or shipping cost and are the sole responsibility of the recipient. Knotivira has no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. We recommend contacting your local customs office for more information before placing an international order.</p>

                <h3>5.6. Risk of Loss</h3>
                <p>The risk of loss and title for items purchased from Knotivira pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier. This means that once the package leaves our facility and is in the hands of the shipping carrier, you are responsible for any loss or damage to the items. We recommend purchasing shipping insurance if you are concerned about potential loss or damage during transit.</p>

                <h3>5.7. Incorrect Shipping Information</h3>
                <p>It is your responsibility to provide accurate and complete shipping information at the time of purchase.

If a package is returned to us due to an incorrect address, you may be responsible for re-shipping fees.</p>

                <h2>6. Returns, Refunds, and Exchanges</h2>

                </ul>
                <p>Please note that Digital Products (patterns, e-books, workshop access) are generally non-refundable once downloaded or accessed, due to their intangible nature. Please see section 7 for specific terms regarding Digital Products.</p>

                <p>To initiate a return or exchange, please contact our customer service team at [customer service email] within the eligible return period. You will be provided with instructions on how to return your item(s). You will typically be responsible for the cost of return shipping, unless the return is due to an error on our part (e.g., wrong item shipped, defective product).</p>
                <p>We recommend using a trackable shipping service and purchasing shipping insurance when returning items, as we cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned item.</p>

Shipping costs from the original order are non-refundable, unless the return is due to our error.</p>
                <p>If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at [customer service email].</p>

                <h3>6.4. Exchanges</h3>
                <p>If you wish to exchange an item, please follow the return process for the original item and place a new order for the desired item.

                <h3>6.5. Damaged or Defective Items</h3>
                <p>If you receive a damaged or defective item, please contact us immediately (within [X] days of delivery) with details of the defect and photographic evidence.

                    <li>You may sell a limited number of finished items made from Knotivira Patterns on a small-scale, handmade basis, provided that you clearly credit "Knotivira" as the pattern designer in your product description. This "small-scale, handmade basis" typically refers to individual crafters selling items directly to consumers, not mass production or factory manufacturing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You are expressly prohibited from:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Modifying, adapting, translating, reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling any part of the Pattern, except as necessary for your personal use in creating the physical item.</li>
                    <li>Using the Pattern for large-scale commercial production or manufacturing without a separate commercial licensing agreement with Knotivira.</li>
                    <li>Claiming the Pattern as your own design or removing any copyright notices or branding from the Pattern.</li>
                    <li>Using the Pattern to create derivative digital products (e.g., translating the pattern into another language and selling it, or creating a new digital pattern based heavily on ours).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Violation of these licensing terms constitutes a breach of these Terms and may result in the termination of your Account and legal action for copyright infringement.</p>

                <h2>15. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Site, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally and in good faith.

                <p>If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute informally within a reasonable period (e.g., 30 days), either party may elect to pursue binding arbitration as the sole and exclusive means of resolving disputes, subject to the provisions below. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (as amended) of India.</p>

                <h3>15.1. Binding Arbitration</h3>
                <p>All claims and disputes arising under or relating to these Terms are to be settled by binding arbitration in Delhi, India, or another location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration shall be administered by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the rules of a recognized arbitration institution in India (e.g., the Delhi International Arbitration Centre or Indian Council of Arbitration). The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties.</p>
                <p>The arbitration shall be conducted in English. The costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees and administrative expenses, shall be shared equally by both parties, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise. Each party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration.</p>

                <h3>15.2. Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent Knotivira from seeking relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for claims related to the collection of payment for products or services, or for claims related to your breach of the "Prohibited Uses" section of these Terms.</p>

                <h3>15.3. Class Action Waiver</h3>
                <p>YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST KNOTIVIRA ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Unless both you and Knotivira agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

                <h2>16. Termination</h2>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your Account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.</p>
                <p>If you wish to terminate your Account, you may simply discontinue using the Service or contact us to request account deletion. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease.</p>
                <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
                <p>Knotivira reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Site or any part thereof, at any time, without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to, a breach of these Terms. We may also, at our sole discretion, discontinue providing the Site or any part thereof, with or without notice.</p>

                <h2>17. Third-Party Links</h2>
                <p>Our Site may contain links to websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Knotivira. For example, we may link to yarn manufacturers, independent pattern designers, crafting communities, or educational resources. These links are provided for your convenience and information only.</p>
                <p>Knotivira has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites. You acknowledge and agree that Knotivira shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such third-party web sites or services.</p>
                <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit. Your interaction with any third-party website linked from our Site is solely at your own risk.</p>

                <h2>18. Changes to Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
                <p>We encourage you to review these Terms periodically for any changes. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will indicate when the Terms were last revised. Your continued use of the Site after any changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

                <h2>19. Severability</h2>
                <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision.</p>
                <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If Knotivira does not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking these Terms, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>
