                <h3>1.3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
                <p>Knotivira uses "cookies" and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience on our Site. Cookies are small data files placed on your device by a website that you visit. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Our use of cookies falls into several categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of our Site. They enable core functionalities such as security, network management, and accessibility. Without these cookies, certain services you have asked for cannot be provided. For example, they allow you to log into secure areas of the Site or remember items in your shopping cart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance and Analytics Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information about how you use our Site, such as which pages you visit most often, and if you encounter error messages. They help us understand and improve the performance of our Site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. We use third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics) that use cookies to generate statistical information about website usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, they can remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising and Targeting Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Cookies:</strong> These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the Site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition to cookies, we may use other tracking technologies such as web beacons, pixels, and tags. These are small graphic files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site or opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Site to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance.</p>
                <p>You have the option to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. However, this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website. For more detailed information on how we use cookies and your choices regarding them, please refer to our dedicated <a href="cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

                <h3>1.4. Information from Third Parties</h3>
                <p>In some circumstances, we may receive information about you from third-party sources. This can occur when you interact with our brand on other platforms or when we partner with other entities. Examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Platforms:</strong> If you choose to connect with us through social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest), those platforms may provide us with information about you in accordance with their privacy policies and your privacy settings on those platforms. This could include your public profile information, friends list, or email address.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> While we do not directly store your full payment card details, our payment processors may provide us with limited transaction information (e.g., last four digits of your card, transaction ID) to confirm successful payments and for fraud prevention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing and Advertising Partners:</strong> We may receive information from marketing and advertising partners about your interests or demographics to help us tailor our advertising efforts and reach relevant audiences. This data is typically aggregated or pseudonymized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Publicly Available Sources:</strong> We may collect information from publicly accessible sources, such as public databases or open government records, to verify or supplement the information we hold about you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We only collect information from third parties where we have a legitimate basis to do so, or where you have provided your consent for such sharing. We ensure that any third-party data we integrate is handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.</p>

                <h3>3.7. Legal Requirements</h3>

                <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>Knotivira retains your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law. The retention period depends on the type of data and the purpose for which it was collected. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We retain your account information for as long as your account is active. If you close your account, we may retain certain data for a limited period to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Order and Transaction Data:</strong> We retain data related to your purchases for accounting, tax, and warranty purposes, typically for a period required by applicable financial regulations (e.g., 7 years in many jurisdictions).</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing Preferences:</strong> We retain your marketing preferences for as long as you remain subscribed to our communications or until you withdraw your consent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Usage data is generally retained for a shorter period, unless it is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Service Records:</strong> Correspondence with customer service may be retained for a reasonable period to help us resolve future inquiries and improve our service.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When your personal information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected, or when you request its deletion (subject to legal exceptions), we will securely delete or anonymize it. Anonymized data, which cannot be linked back to you, may be retained for analytical and statistical purposes indefinitely.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>The security of your data is of paramount importance to us. Knotivira implements a variety of robust security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We employ industry-standard practices and technologies to safeguard your data, both during transmission and once we receive it. These measures include, but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption (SSL/TLS):</strong> Our Site uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to protect data transmitted between your browser and our servers. This ensures that all data, including personal and payment information, is encrypted during transit, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> We utilize firewalls to create a barrier between our internal network and external networks, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to your personal information is restricted to authorized employees, contractors, and agents of Knotivira who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We adhere to the principle of data minimization, collecting only the personal information that is necessary for the stated purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Security Audits and Updates:</strong> Our systems are regularly monitored for vulnerabilities and attacks. We also perform routine security audits and apply necessary software updates and patches to address potential security weaknesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Payment Processing:</strong> As mentioned, we do not directly store sensitive payment card information. All payment transactions are processed through PCI-DSS compliant third-party payment gateways that use strong encryption and security protocols.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Our servers are hosted in secure data centers with physical access controls, surveillance, and environmental monitoring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> All Knotivira employees receive training on data privacy and security best practices to ensure they understand their responsibilities in protecting your information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage you to also take steps to protect your personal information, such as using strong, unique passwords, not sharing your login credentials, and logging out of your account after each session, especially when using public or shared computers.</p>
                <p>In the unlikely event of a data breach, we have procedures in place to promptly assess the situation, mitigate any potential harm, and notify affected individuals and relevant authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
                <p>Depending on your geographical location and applicable data protection laws (such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK, or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) for California residents), you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. Knotivira is committed to facilitating the exercise of these rights. These rights may include:</p>

                <h3>6.1. Right to Access (Right to be Informed)</h3>
                <p>You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you. This includes the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and certain information regarding the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, the period for which the personal data will be stored, and the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing.</p>

                <h3>6.2. Right to Rectification (Correction)</h3>
                <p>You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold about you. If you believe any of your personal information is incorrect, please contact us immediately so we can update our records. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is accurate and up-to-date.</p>

                <h3>6.3. Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)</h3>
                <p>In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion or removal of your personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. This right applies if: the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected; you withdraw consent; you object to processing and there are no overriding legitimate interests; the data has been unlawfully processed; or the data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation. Please note that this right is not absolute and may be subject to certain legal exceptions (e.g., if we need to retain your data for legal compliance or to complete a transaction).</p>

                <h3>6.4. Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
                <p>You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain situations. This means that we would temporarily store your data but not process it further. This right applies if: you contest the accuracy of the data (for a period enabling us to verify its accuracy); the processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure and request restriction instead; we no longer need the data for the purposes of the processing, but you require it for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or you have objected to processing pending the verification whether our legitimate grounds override yours.</p>

                <h3>6.5. Right to Data Portability</h3>
                <p>You have the right to receive your personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from us, where the processing is based on consent or on a contract and is carried out by automated means. This allows you to easily transfer your data to another service provider if you wish.</p>

                <h3>6.6. Right to Object</h3>
                <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, particularly when we are processing your data based on our legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes. If you object to direct marketing, we will cease processing your data for that purpose. If you object to processing based on legitimate interests, we will stop unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>

                <h3>6.7. Rights related to Automated Decision Making and Profiling</h3>
                <p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, unless such decision is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between you and us, is authorized by law, or is based on your explicit consent.</p>

                <h3>6.8. Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
                <p>Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally agreed, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.</p>

                <h3>6.9. Exercising Your Rights</h3>
                <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details provided in the "Contact Us" section below. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
                <p>We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
                <p>If you are in the EEA or UK, and you believe that our processing of your personal data infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</p>

                <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>Knotivira is based in India. Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction. For instance, if you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK and we process your personal data in India, this involves a transfer of data outside of the EEA/UK.</p>
                <p>We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and that no transfer of your personal data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information. This includes implementing appropriate safeguards such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):</strong> For transfers of personal data from the EEA or UK to countries not deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission or the UK government, we implement Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission or the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). These clauses provide contractual commitments to protect personal data to the standard required by EU/UK data protection law.</li>
                    <li><strong>Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs):</strong> If applicable, for transfers within our corporate group, we may rely on Binding Corporate Rules, which are internal rules approved by data protection authorities that define our global privacy policy regarding transfers of personal data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adequacy Decisions:</strong> We may transfer data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission or the UK government.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Explicit Consent:</strong> In specific situations, we may rely on your explicit consent for international data transfers, particularly when no other legal basis for transfer applies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By submitting your personal data to us, you agree to this transfer, storing, or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Knotivira's Site and services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, please contact us immediately. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
                <p>In some jurisdictions, the age of digital consent may be higher than 13. Where this is the case, we adhere to the higher age limit. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activities and to use parental control tools to help provide a child-friendly online environment.</p>

                <h2>9. Links to Other Websites</h2>
                <p>Our Site may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. For example, we may link to yarn suppliers, pattern designers, or crafting blogs. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
                <p>Knotivira has no control over and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Knotivira of the site or any association with its operators. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

                <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
